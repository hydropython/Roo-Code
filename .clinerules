# 2026 DETERMINISTIC PROTOCOL

## RULE 1: THE HANDSHAKE
Before you perform ANY coding task, you MUST initialize your session by calling:
selectActiveIntent(intentId: 'INT-002')
- You must strictly follow the <owned_scope> provided in the XML response.
- Do NOT touch files outside that scope.

## RULE 2: THE GOLDEN THREAD (LOGGING)
Every time you create, modify, or delete a file, you MUST immediately run the following hook to log the hash to the ledger:
python .orchestration/hooks/tmd.py '<INTENT_ID>' '<FILE_PATH>' '<NEW_CONTENT>'
- This is mandatory for traceability.
