TOOL EXECUTION RULES (CRITICAL):

Always use Roo tools when interacting with the workspace.

After EVERY tool call, you MUST provide a short confirmation message describing the result before continuing.

Workflow:
1. Call ONE tool at a time.
2. Wait for the result.
3. Briefly summarize the result.
4. Then decide the next action.

Never call multiple tools in one response.
Never end a response immediately after a tool call.
Always include a short natural-language confirmation after tool usage.

Prefer small sequential actions over complex plans.
